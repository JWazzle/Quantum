    /// ## input
    /// The register to shift. It can be any length, and in any state.

    /// ## output
    /// The register to shift the input into. It must be the same length as

    /// representing the desired input. Your goal is to run the operation in
    /// "classical mode", which means running it on a single input (rather
    /// than a superposition), and measuring the output (rather than the
    /// input).
    ///
    /// More specifically, you must do this:
    /// 1. Create a qubit register and put it in the same state as the input
    ///    bit string.

    /// string.
